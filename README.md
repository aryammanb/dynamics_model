The ReadMe.pdf file contains the documentation and instructions to use the model.

This is part of work I did as a member of Student Satellite Programme, IIT Bombay.

It is a 6DOF Nanosatellite Dynamics Simulation model which I built in simulink from scratch.

It also contains additional features such as calculating the solar vector, magnetic field vector, etc. with respect to the satellite so that teams building an estimator could evaluate their model.
